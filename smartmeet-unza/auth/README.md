# Authentication UI Stubs

This folder contains stubs and assets for the authentication interface of SmartMeet UNZA.

Planned files:
- login.html — Login form UI
- register.html — Registration form UI
- reset.html — Password reset/request UI
- styles.css — Optional shared styles for the auth pages
- auth.js — Optional shared behavior (form validation, toggles)

Guidelines:
- Keep pages lightweight and responsive (mobile-first)
- Use shared styles and components where possible
- Keep forms accessible (labels, aria attributes, proper input types)

Next steps:
1) Add the three HTML stub pages (login, register, reset)
2) Link a shared stylesheet and script if needed
3) Wire navigation from existing user/admin UIs to these pages
